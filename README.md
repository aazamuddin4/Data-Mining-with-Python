# Data-Mining-with-Python
Including various project using Jupyter Notebook
## Homework Assignment #1: Setup Your Workstation
#Details:
 
1. Download and install Jupyter notebook, and get familiar with the software. Create a new notebook and call it "Homework #1".

2. Review the data sources mentioned in the "Sample Datasets" video. Browse through any datasets that interest you, until you find a dataset that includes a "date" column. Download that dataset and save it in the same directory as your new notebook. (DOWNLOADED DATA SETS FROM KAGGLE)

3. Import the data into your notebook.

4. Use df.shape() to determine the number of rows and columns in the data.

5. Use df.head() to display a small sample of the data (~15 rows) in your notebook

6. Add a "day of the week" column  (which parses the date column and computes the day of the week automatically)

7. Add a comment to the code you wrote in step #6, explaining what that code is doing.
